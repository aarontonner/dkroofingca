If you’re a commercial building owner in Southern California, you know the never-ending battle between the sun and your roof. The good news? Not every worn out flat roof needs a full replacement. Roof coatings — especially acrylic — are a powerful way to restore performance, extend life and avoid the cost and disruption of a tear-off. In this blog we’ll explore when coatings are the right solution and how they benefit property owners in Redlands, Highland, Victorville and more.

## **What is Acrylic Roof Coating and How Does it Work?**

Acrylic roof coating is a liquid applied membrane that creates a seamless, waterproof and UV resistant barrier over your existing roof. Once cured it acts like a second skin — protecting your building from heat, moisture and membrane wear. It’s an ideal solution for TPO, EPDM, modified bitumen and even some metal roofing systems.

Coatings can be applied to flat or low slope commercial roofs and are a popular restoration option in cities with high sun exposure like Palmdale, Lancaster and Apple Valley.

Maintenance Tip: Before applying any coating have your roofer inspect for moisture below the surface. Trapped water can cause blistering or adhesion failure later on.

## **Benefits of Acrylic Roof Coatings for Inland California Buildings**

First, coatings save money. A full roof replacement in California can cost $8–$14 per square foot depending on the size of the building and material. Coating restoration typically runs 40–60% less and often qualifies for similar warranties.

Second, they’re energy efficient. Acrylic coatings are highly reflective reducing rooftop temperature by up to 80°F. That’s a big deal for retail and medical buildings in Menifee, Murrieta and Temecula where summer bills can get out of control.

Third, coatings minimize disruption. Business owners in busy downtown Redlands or Highland plazas don’t want weeks of noisy tear-offs. Roof coating systems are applied quickly, with little mess and usually no closure.

Maintenance Tip: Reapply your topcoat every 8–10 years to extend the system’s life. Most coating warranties offer up to 15 years with proper care.

\*\*When is a Roof a Good Candidate for Coating?\*\*Acrylic coating works best on structurally sound roofs with minimal saturated insulation. If your roof has no major leaks, no large ponding and at least 70–80% of its membrane intact it’s likely a candidate for restoration.

Buildings in cities like Banning, Yucaipa and Perris — where many commercial properties are 15–20 years old — often have roofs nearing the end of their lifecycle but still salvageable with a coating system.

Maintenance Tip: Schedule a thermal inspection to identify wet insulation. A dry base is critical for successful coating adhesion.

## **When NOT to Use Roof Coatings**

If your roof has widespread leaks, multiple layers or active structural damage coating may not be effective. Also roofs with heavy foot traffic — like equipment laden roofs on warehouses in Victorville or industrial zones in Lancaster — may require reinforced membranes instead.

Maintenance Tip: Use walk pads or designated access paths if your roof needs regular technician traffic. This reduces wear and tear.

## **Coating Process Step-by-Step**

1. **Inspection**: We assess substrate integrity, slope and existing issues.
2. **Cleaning**: The surface is power-washed and debris is removed.
3. **Repair Prep**: Seams, blisters and cracks are repaired and reinforced.
4. **Base Coat**: Applied evenly for adhesion and base waterproofing.
5. **Top Coat**: Applied with high reflectivity for energy savings and UV defense.

Maintenance Tip: Add a roof coating inspection to your annual facility checklist — even if it’s new. Catching surface issues early ensures performance longevity.

## **Why Roof Coatings Are Popular in Our 15 Inland Cities**

From high elevation cities like Beaumont to hot weather hubs like Perris and Hesperia roof coatings solve a major problem: aging roofs that don’t yet warrant full replacement. Cities like Redlands and Highland with many public and historic buildings also benefit — since coatings can be applied without altering structural elements.

In cities like Temecula and Lake Elsinore coatings allow restaurant and retail owners to avoid disrupting customers while still improving roof life and reducing cooling bills.

Maintenance Tip: In fire prone areas choose a UL rated coating system for added safety and insurance benefits.
