## **How to Choose the Right Commercial Roofing System for California’s Inland Cities**

If you manage a commercial property in California’s inland cities like Perris, Redlands or Palmdale your roof is under constant pressure from the climate. The heat, UV exposure and wind patterns in this region demand durable, efficient and code compliant roofing systems. Choosing the wrong roofing material or installation method can lead to costly repairs, premature failure or increased energy bills. That’s why it’s critical to choose the right system from the start. Let’s get into what you need to know when selecting a roofing system for your commercial property.

## **Commercial Roofing Challenges in California’s Inland Cities**

California’s inland regions are known for their intense summer heat, dry conditions and sudden weather shifts. Cities like Lancaster, Apple Valley and Murrieta can see roof surface temperatures exceed 150°F in peak months. This kind of heat can cause traditional materials like asphalt or low end modified bitumen to crack, blister and deteriorate quickly.

Plus wind uplift is a major concern in areas like Beaumont and Highland where seasonal winds whip through the valley. This pressure can lift poorly attached membranes especially on wide flat roofs. For buildings near foothills or open spaces these forces are even more intense.

Pro Tip: Schedule roof inspections after high wind events. These storms may not cause visible damage but can compromise the seals or edges of your roofing membrane.

## **Top Roofing Systems for Inland California Properties**

TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) is one of the best roofing options for hot inland areas. It reflects sunlight, reduces cooling costs and resists UV damage better than many traditional materials. TPO is also lightweight and heat weldable, which means fewer seams to fail over time.

PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) is another great option especially for buildings where grease, chemicals or other contaminants are present – like restaurants or medical facilities. It shares many benefits with TPO but also has enhanced chemical resistance.

For building owners on a budget or working with older structures acrylic roof coatings can be a practical option. These coatings are applied over an existing roof to extend its life and improve reflectivity. They’re ideal for cities like Yucaipa, Redlands and Lake Elsinore where many commercial roofs are 15-25 years old but still structurally sound.Pro Tip: Consider combining a roof coating with a solar installation. The coating keeps the surface cool, improves solar efficiency and preserves your roof.

## **Choosing Based on Building Use**

Industrial and warehouse spaces in Perris and Lancaster have large open span roofs that benefit from seamless membrane installations. These structures often have HVAC systems or equipment that create ponding water so slope and drainage must be considered when choosing materials.

Retail centers in Temecula, Menifee and Murrieta prioritize aesthetics and tenant comfort. Cool roofing systems reduce indoor temperatures and energy bills creating a more comfortable experience for shoppers and reducing costs for tenants.

Medical offices and educational buildings in Redlands, Highland and Banning require clean low-VOC materials and installations with minimal disruption. PVC or TPO roofs are often best here because of ease of maintenance and long lifespan.

Pro Tip: If your building serves the public choose roofing materials with the highest fire ratings and minimal odors during installation.

## **City-Specific Considerations**

In Palmdale and Victorville elevation plays a role in how roofs wear over time. UV exposure and temperature swings cause expansion and contraction cycles that can split seams and degrade adhesives. Roofs in these areas should be installed with flexible reinforced membranes to withstand the movement.

Lake Elsinore and Temecula get heavy seasonal rains. For these cities drainage design is key. Make sure your roof has internal drains, scuppers or proper slope design to move water off the surface quickly.

Pro Tip: Clean your roof’s drainage paths twice a year—especially before the rainy season. Debris buildup is one of the leading causes of roof leaks.
